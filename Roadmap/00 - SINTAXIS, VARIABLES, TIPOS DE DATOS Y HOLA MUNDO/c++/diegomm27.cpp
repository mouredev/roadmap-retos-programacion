    Code comments can be made by different ways:

        1. For a long piece of code, we can use '/*' to start a comment and the reverse to finish it.
        2. Using two slices slashes '//' to comment all the code in a line.

/*

    Character types: They can represent a single character, such as 'A' or '$'. The most basic type is char, which is a one-byte character. Other types are also provided for wider characters.
    Numerical integer types: They can store a whole number value, such as 7 or 1024. They exist in a variety of sizes, and can either be signed or unsigned, depending on whether they support negative values or not.
    Floating-point types: They can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different levels of precision, depending on which of the three floating-point types is used.
    Boolean type: The boolean type, known in C++ as bool, can only represent one of two states, true or false.
