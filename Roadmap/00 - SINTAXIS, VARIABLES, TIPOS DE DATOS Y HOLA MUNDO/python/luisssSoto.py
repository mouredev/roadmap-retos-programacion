#1. This is a comment in Python, and here is the official URL: https://www.python.org/

#2. In python is not possible to type a multiline comment with only "#"
# however, you can use another method calls "doc string":

"""Doc string """
'''is a way to write information, frequently use it in modules,
to any user that want to use our module, so you can type specific 
information about what the name is and what the purpose is'''

#3 Python doesn't have a strict way to declare variables as
# constants and only variables, but it's a good practice to
# type a constant with uppercase and variables with lowercase:

fullName = input('Write your name: ')
PI = 3.1416

#4. Primitive data types in Python are called literals

string = 'It\'s any amount of characters that you want'
integer = 30
float = 2.718281828459045
boolean = True
boolean = False
none = None

#5 In python it's quite easy to print somethin, just look it:
print('Hello Python!!!')
