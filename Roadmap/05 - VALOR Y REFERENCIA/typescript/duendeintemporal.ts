//Variables by Value

/*Primitive data types in JavaScript (such as number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) are assigned by value. This means that when you assign a primitive value to a variable, a copy of that value is made.*/

let a: number = 44; // a is a number (primitive type)
let b: number = a;  // b is assigned the value of a

log(a); //  44
log(b); //  44

b += 20; // Changing b does not affect a
log(a); //  44
log(b); //  64

//Variables by Reference

/*Reference data types in JavaScript (such as object, array, and function) are assigned by reference. This means that when you assign an object to a variable, you are actually assigning a reference to that object, not a copy of it.*/


let obj1: { name: string, age?: number } = { name: "Julia" }; // obj1 is an object (reference type)
let obj2: { name: string, age?: number } = obj1; // obj2 is assigned the reference of obj1

log(obj1.name); //  Julia
log(obj2.name); //  Julia

obj2.name = "Karla"; // Changing obj2 affects obj1 because they reference the same object
log(obj1.name); //  Karla
log(obj2.name); //  Karla

obj2.age = 32;
log(obj2.age)// 32
log(obj1.age)// 32

//Arrays (Reference Type) in JavaScript are also reference types.

let arr1: number[] = [7, 4, 90]; // arr1 is an array (reference type)
let arr2: number[] = arr1; // arr2 is assigned the reference of arr1

log(arr1); //  [7, 4, 90]
log(arr2); //  [7, 4, 90]

arr2.push(42); // Modifying arr2 affects arr1
log(arr1); //  [7, 4, 90, 42]
log(arr2); //  [7, 4, 90, 42]

/*    By Value: Primitive types (e.g., number, string) are copied when assigned to a new variable.
    By Reference: Reference types (e.g., object, array) are assigned by reference, meaning changes to one variable affect the other if they reference the same object. */

  /*  In JavaScript, functions are also treated as first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

/*  In JavaScript, when you pass arguments to a function, the behavior depends on whether the argument is a primitive type (passed by value) or a reference type (passed by reference). Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates both concepts:  */

/* EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):

    Create two programs that receive two parameters (each) defined as variables previously.
    One program receives, in one case, two parameters by value, and in another case, by reference.
    These parameters are swapped between each other internally, returned, and their return values are assigned to two variables different from the originals. Then, print the value of the original variables and the new ones, checking that their values have been inverted in the second set.
    Also verify that the original values have been preserved in the first set.

/*
 * Note: Destructuring allows us to achieve both effects:
 * - Preserving original values by assigning swapped values to new variables.
 * - Swapping values in place by updating the original variables.

 * Note 2: Destructuring creates a shallow copy. If objects are nested, the nested objects are not copied.
