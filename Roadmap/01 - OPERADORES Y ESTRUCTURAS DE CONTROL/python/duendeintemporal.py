# SIMPLE MATEMATICAL OPERATORS

# DIVISION
""" Python does integer division when both operands are integers. The behavior of Python's division operators have changed from Python 2.x and 3.x (*see also Integer Division ). """

a, b, c, d, e = 3, 2, 2.0, -3, 10

print(a / b) # = 1.5
print(a / c) # = 1.5
print(d / b) # = -1.5
print(b / a) # = 0.6666666666666666
print(d / e) # = -0.3

d /= b # = -1.5
print(d) # = -1.5


# The ' // ' operator in Python 2 forces floored division regardless of type.
print(a // c) # = 1.0 (Integer Division)
float(a) / float(b) # = 1.5 

''' Possible combinations (builtin types):
int and int (gives an int in Python 2 and a float in Python 3)
int and float (gives a float)
int and complex (gives a complex)
float and float (gives a float)
float and complex (gives a complex)
complex and complex (gives a complex) '''

# ADDITION

print(a + b) # = 5
a += e # = 13

# SUBSTRACTION

print(e - b) # = 8
e -= a + 2 # = -5

import operator # contains 2 argument arithmetic functions
operator.sub(b, a) # = -1

# MULTIPLICATION

print(e * e) # = 25
e *= b # = -10
print(e) # = -10

import operator
operator.mul(e, e) # = 25

# EXPONENTIATION

a, b = 2, 3
(a ** b) # = 8
pow(a, b) # = 8 

import math
math.pow(a, b) # = 8.0 (always float; does not allow complex results)

import operator
operator.pow(a, b) # = 8

# Another difference between the built-in pow and math.pow is that the built-in pow can accept three arguments:
a, b, c = 2, 3, 2
pow(2, 3, 2) # 0, calculates (2 ** 3) % 2, but as per Python docs,
# does so more efficiently

# MODULUS
print(3 % 4) # 3
print(10 % 2) # 0
print(6 % 4) # 2

#Or by using the operator module:
import operator
operator.mod(3 , 4) # 3
operator.mod(10 , 2) # 0
operator.mod(6 , 4) # 2

#You can also use negative numbers.
print(-9 % 7) # 5
print(9 % -7) # -5
print(-9 % -7) # -2

#If you need to find the result of integer division and modulus, you can use the divmod function as a shortcut:
quotient, remainder = divmod(9, 4)
# quotient = 2, remainder = 1 as 4 * 2 + 1 == 9

# INPLACE OPERATIONS

# It is common within applications to need to have code like this:
a = a + 1
# or
a = a * 2
# There is an effective shortcut for these in place operations:
a += 1
# and
a *= 2

''' Any mathematic operator can be used before the '=' character to make an inplace operation:
-= decrement the variable in place
+= increment the variable in place
*= multiply the variable in place
/= divide the variable in place
//= floor divide the variable in place # Python 3
%= return the modulus of the variable in place
**= raise to a power in place '''

#BITWISE OPERATORS
""" #The ~ operator will flip all of the bits in the number. Since computers use signed number representations â€” most notably, the two's complement notation to encode negative binary numbers where negative numbers are written with a leading one (1) instead of a leading zero (0). from 0000 0000 to 0111 1111 to represent numbers from 0 to 127 and reserve 1xxx xxxx to represent negative numbers.
#Eight-bit two's-complement numbers Bits Unsigned Value Two's-complement Value 0000 0000 0 0 0000 0001 1 1 0000 0010 2 2 0111 1110 126 126 0111 1111 127 127 1000 0000 128 -128 1000 0001 129 -127 1000 0010 130 -126 1111 1110 254 -2 1111 1111 255 -1
#In essence, this means that whereas 1010 0110 has an unsigned value of 166 (arrived at by adding (128 * 1) + (64 * 0) + (32 * 1) + (16 * 0) + (8 * 0) + (4 * 1) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 0)), it has a two's-complement value of -90 (arrived at by adding (128 * 1) - (64 * 0) - (32 * 1) - (16 * 0) - (8 * 0) - (4 * 1) - (2 * 1) - (1 * 0), and complementing the value).
#In this way, negative numbers range down to -128 (1000 0000). Zero (0) is represented as 0000 0000, and minus one (-1) as 1111 1111. """
#In general, though, this means ~n = -n - 1.
# 0 = 0b0000 0000
print(~0) # Out: -1
# -1 = 0b1111 1111
# 1 = 0b0000 0001
print(~1) # Out: -2
# -2 = 1111 1110
# 2 = 0b0000 0010
print(~2) # Out: -3
# -3 = 0b1111 1101
# 123 = 0b0111 1011
print(~123) # Out: -124
# -124 = 0b1000 0100
#Note, the overall effect of this operation when applied to positive numbers can be summarized:
#~n -> -|n+1|
#And then, when applied to negative numbers, the corresponding effect is:
#~-n -> |n-1|

print(False and 'Angy')  # False
print(4 < 5 and 8 > 6)  # True

# Note: Both AND and OR are short-circuit operators, meaning sometimes only the first operator is evaluated.

# Multiplicative Operators
# There are three multiplicative operators in Python: multiply, divide, and modulus.
# These operators work similarly to their counterparts in languages such as Java, C, and Perl,
# but they also include some automatic type conversions when dealing with non-numeric values.

# Multiply Operator *
number = 4 * int('8')

# Divide Operator /
number = 10 / 5

# Modulus (remainder) Operator %
number = 41 % 5
print(number)  # Logs: 1

# Exponentiation Operator **
number = 4 ** 2
print(number)  # Logs: 16
# same as
print(pow(4, 2))  # Logs: 16

# Add Operator +
number = 76 + 78
print(number)  # Logs: 154
print('76' + '78')  # Logs: 7678 (string concatenation)

number = 767867686876876 + 6757575755
print(number)  # Logs: 767874444452631

# Subtract -
number = 48 - 3
print(number)  # Logs: 45

# Note: These operators have particular behavior in some cases when used with 'inf'(Infinity), 0, 'nan'(NaN not a number).

# Relational Operators
# The less-than (<), greater-than (>), less-than-or-equal-to (<=), and greater-than-or-equal-to (>=)
# relational operators perform comparisons between values similarly to what you learned in math class.

computation = 76 < 4
print(computation)  # Logs: False
computation = 87 > 32
print(computation)  # Logs: True
computation = 43 <= 43

except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Handle the error and print a message
# TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'int'   
#This way the program doesn't interrup with the TypeError

print("43" < "8")  # Logs: True
try:
    print("43" < 8)  # This will raise a TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Handle the error and print a message
# TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'     

print('DeepState' < 'real people')  # Logs: True  
# True not only cause are more real people, but when we talk about strings the upper characters has lower codes than the regulars ones
print('deepstate' < 'real people')  # Logs: True
# True again ... well ummm sometimes we win 

#Comparison Behavior in Python
#Numeric Comparison:
#If both operands are numbers (integers or floats), Python performs a numeric comparison directly.

print(5 > 3)  # True

#String Comparison:
#If both operands are strings, Python compares them lexicographically (dictionary order) based on the Unicode code points of the characters.

print("apple" < "banana")  # True

#Mixed Types (Number and String):
#If one operand is a number and the other is a string, Python raises a TypeError. Unlike JavaScript, Python does not automatically convert types for comparison.

try:
    print(5 > "3")  # Raises TypeError
except TypeError:
    print("Cannot compare number and string!")  # This will be printed

#Boolean Comparison:
#Booleans in Python are a subclass of integers. True is treated as 1 and False as 0 when compared with numbers.

print(True == 1)  # True
print(False == 0)  # True

#Object Comparison:
#If the operands are objects, Python will use the __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__, __eq__, or __ne__ methods defined in the class of the objects to perform the comparison. If these methods are not defined, Python will raise a TypeError if the objects are of incompatible types.

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.value < other.value

obj1 = MyClass(1)
obj2 = MyClass(2)
print(obj1 < obj2)  # True

# Equality operators
# Determining whether two variables are equivalent is one of the most important operations in programming.

# Equal or Equality Operator ==
print(2 == '2')  # Logs: False (2 is an integer, '2' is a string)

# Not-equal or Inequality Operator !=
print(2 != '2')  # Logs: True (2 is not equal to '2' because they are different types)

# In Python, there is no strict equality operator (===) or strict inequality operator (!==) like in JavaScript.
# The == and != operators perform value comparisons without type checking.

# Checking both value and type
print(2 == '2' and type(2) == type('2'))  # Logs: False
print(2 != '2' and type(2) != type('2'))  # Logs: True


#Equality and Comparison Rules in Python
#Boolean Values:
#In Python, when using the equality (==) operator, True is treated as 1 and False as 0. However, there is no implicit conversion of Booleans to numeric values for comparison; they are compared directly.
print(True == 1)  # True
print(False == 0)  # True

# String and Number Comparison:
# Python does not automatically convert strings to numbers for equality checks.
# Comparing a string with a number using == will return False, not raise an error.

print("5" == 5)  # Logs: False (no TypeError is raised)

# However, if you try to perform an operation that requires both to be the same type, it will raise a TypeError.
try:
    result = "5" + 5  # This will raise TypeError
except TypeError:
    print("Cannot add string and number!")  # This will be printed


# Object Comparison:
# In Python, if one operand is an object and the other is not, the comparison will depend on the type of the other operand.
# If the other operand is not compatible, a TypeError will be raised.

class MyClass:
    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Custom equality check (optional)
        return isinstance(other, MyClass)

obj = MyClass()

# Comparing the same object
print(obj == obj)  # True (same object)

# Comparing with a different object of the same class
another_obj = MyClass()
print(obj == another_obj)  # False (unless __eq__ is defined to return True for same class)

# Comparing with a non-object (like an integer)
try:
    print(obj == 5)  # This will raise TypeError if __eq__ is not defined for MyClass
except TypeError:
    print("Cannot compare object and non-object!")  # This will be printed if TypeError occurs

# If __eq__ is defined, it will return False instead of raising an error
print(obj == "string")  # This will raise TypeError if __eq__ is not defined for MyClass

# None Values:
# In Python, None is a singleton object and is used to signify 'no value' or 'null'.
# It is equal to itself but not equal to any other value.
print(None == None)  # True (None is equal to None)
print(None == 0)     # False (None is not equal to 0)

# NaN (Not a Number):
# Python has a specific representation for NaN, which is float('nan').
# In Python, NaN is not equal to itself, which is a property of NaN in the IEEE floating-point standard.
import math
print(math.isnan(float('nan')))  # True (math.isnan() correctly identifies NaN)
print(float('nan') == float('nan'))  # False (NaN is not equal to NaN)

# Additional note: NaN is often used in data analysis and scientific computing to represent undefined or unrepresentable values.

# Object Identity:
# In Python, the 'is' operator checks for object identity (whether two references point to the same object),
# while '==' checks for value equality.

a = [1, 2, 3]  # List a
b = a         # b references the same object as a
c = a[:]      # c is a shallow copy of a, so it is a different object

print(a is b)  # True (a and b point to the same object)
print(a == c)  # True (a and c have the same value)
print(a is c)  # False (a and c are different objects)

# Checking for NaN
import math
print(math.isnan(float('nan')))  # True (math.isnan() correctly identifies NaN)

# Boolean and None comparisons
print(True == 1)  # True (True is equal to 1 in Python)
print(None == float('nan'))  # False (None is not equal to NaN)
print(None is None)  # True (None is equal to itself)

# Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator)
# In Python, the conditional expression (also known as the ternary operator) allows for conditional assignment to a variable.
# The syntax is: true_value if condition else false_value

user = {'name': 'Nixon'}  # Example user dictionary

# Conditional expression to determine the login message
login = f"Successful login, Welcome {user['name']}" if user['name'] != 'Nixon' else "Sorry we don't have any user with that name"
print(login)  # Logs: Sorry we don't have any user with that name

# Assignment Operators
a = 'a'  # Initial assignment
a = a + a  # Concatenating the string with itself
print(a)  # Logs: aa

# Example of using an assignment operator with a number
number = 8
number += 2  # This is equivalent to number = number + 2
print(number)  # Logs: 10

# Compound assignment operators allow you to perform an operation and assign the result to a variable in one step.
# They are done with one of the arithmetic or bitwise operators followed by an equal sign (=).

number = 8  # Initial value
number *= number  # Equivalent to number = number * number
print(number)  # Logs: 64

number -= 4  # Equivalent to number = number - 4
print(number)  # Logs: 60

# Compound-assignment operators exist for each of the major mathematical operations and a few others as well.
# They are as follows:
# - Multiply/assign (*=)
# - Divide/assign (/=)
# - Modulus/assign (%=)
# - Add/assign (+=)
# - Subtract/assign (-=)
# - Left shift/assign (<<=)
# - Signed right shift/assign (>>=)

# Note: Python does not have an unsigned right shift operator (>>>=).

# Membership Operators

    'description': "Mutant fat man lives beyond the margins of the known universe...",
    'age': 600,
}
